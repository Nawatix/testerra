= Always prefer Assertions

If you need to check several properties of a GuiElement, always prefer

. <<Assertions>> due to the human-readable and precise description
. over <<Waiters>> because of their fault tolerance
. over <<Checks>>

[source,java]
----
// Good practice
element.asserts().assertText("Search results");

// Bad practice
Assert.assertTrue(element.getText().contains("Search results"));
