= Always prefer Assertions

If you need to check several properties of a GuiElement, always prefer

. <<Assertions>> due to the human-readable and precise description
. over <<Waiters>> because of their fault tolerance
. over <<Checks>>

[source,java]
----
// Good practice
element.asserts().assertText("Search results");
element.asserts().assertIsDisplayed();

// Bad practice
Assert.assertTrue(element.getText().contains("Search results"));

// Worse practice - could results in fails if page rendering isn't finished yet
Assert.assertTrue(element.isDisplayed());
