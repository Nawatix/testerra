= Element Highlighting
include::../properties/property-attributes.adoc[]

== Demo mode
In the demo mode actions on pages are marked with distinctive coloured frames around the element of the action. This mechanism is set by a property

.test.properties
[source, properties, subs="attributes"]
----
# activate demo mode, default = false
{demomode}=true
----
The following colours are used for highlighting

* [red]#red#: failed visibility checks and asserts
* [green]#green#: successful visibility checks and asserts
* [yellow]#yellow#: mouseOver
* [blue]#blue#: click

== Explicit Highlighting
For debugging purposes a `GuiElement` can call its highlight method to activate the demo mode and highlight the Element just for the current page.

[source, java]
GuiElement loginButton = new GuiElement(driver, By.id('login'));
loginButton.highlight();
// renders a green frame around the loginButton Element of the current Page
