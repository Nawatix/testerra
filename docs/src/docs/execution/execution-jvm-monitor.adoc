The `JVMMonitor` is the Observer of the hardware utilization for memory and cpu.

== How does it work?
With the start of a test while using the `TesterraListener` the latter implicitly starts the `JVMMonitor`.
Thus a concurrent thread for monitoring purposes only is initiated next to the actual test execution. Every ten seconds the following parameters are logged

* JVM Memory Usage      in MB
* JVM Memory Reserved   in MB
* JVM CPU Usage         in per cent

The `JVMMonitor` is automatically terminated after the test execution and a graph showing the memory consumption is put into the report.
