= Browser capabilities

You can customize your WebDriver session by setting capabilities in the following ways:

- <<Global capabilities>> that affect every WebDriver session created
- <<Thread local capabilities>> that affect only WebDrivers created in the current thread
- <<Request capabilities>> that affect only WebDrivers for a given request
- <<User agent configuration>> that affect only WebDrivers for a specified browser

When creating a new WebDriver, these capabilities get merged together in this exact order.
