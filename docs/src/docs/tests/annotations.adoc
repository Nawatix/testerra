= Annotations

== Expect Fail

If you know, that a test will fail, you can mark it with an annotation and an optional description.

[source,java]
----
@Test
@Fails(description="This test fails for reasons")
public void test_ItWillFail() {
    Assert.assertTrue(false);
}
----

In the report this tests are also marked as failed, but they are less highlighted.

If tests are passed again, you get a note in the report to remove the `Fails` annotation.
