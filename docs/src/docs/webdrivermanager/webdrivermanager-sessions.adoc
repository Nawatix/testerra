= WebDriver sessions

include::../properties/property-attributes.adoc[]

Before you can use `WebDriver` sessions, you have to setup a Selenium-compatible server.

== Setup remote sessions

For using a remote Selenium server (e.g. a Selenium Grid) you only have to tell Testerra where it can be find.

.Additional settings in test.properties
[source,properties,subs="attributes"]
----
{webdriver_mode}=remote
{selenium_server_host}=localhost
{selenium_server_port}=4444
{selenium_server_url}=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub
----

NOTE: The browser support depends on the remote selenium setup.

== Create a local session (not recommended)

Regularly, there is no reason to use local Selenium sessions based on binaries.
We won't recommend using that, because we've experienced slightly differences between the local and remote behaviour.

However, Testerra supports using local web drivers.

- Search for your browser's selenium driver online, like _selenium gecko driver_ for Firefox or _selenium crome driver_ for Chrome based browsers
- Download your WebDriver binary from browser vendor's website to a local location
- Make sure the driver version supports your installed browser
- Since the properties are system properties, you need to put the location of the binaries to the `system.properties` file as mentioned in the <<Property files>> section.

.system.properties
[source,properties,subs="attributes"]
----
{webdriver_mode}=local
webdriver.gecko.driver="C:\\absolute\\path\to\\your\\geckodriver.exe"

# or for other browsers
webdriver.chrome.driver=...
webdriver.edge.driver=...
webdriver.ie.driver=...
----

You can also pass the wedriver by the command line using
```bash
-Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=C:\absolute\path\to\your\geckodriver.exe
```

== Usage of WebDriver sessions

Before starting a `WebDriver` session, you should configure your desired browser like.

[source,properties,subs="attributes"]
----
# ...this way
{browser}=firefox
{browser_version}=65

# ... or that way
{browser_setting}=firefox:65
----

On the first call of

[source,java]
----
WebDriver driver = WebDriverManager.getWebDriver();
----

Selenium is triggered to open a new Browser windows with the defined URL.

TIP: Use remote Selenium server as often as possible, also for development.
So your project is independent from any `WebDriver` configuration and needed Webdriver binary files.

For every other call of `getWebDriver()` in the *same test context* WebDriverManager always returns the existing session.

This makes it possible to retrieve the current session in any context and avoids to force the user to pass the instance around.

== Multiple sessions

The WebDriverManager can handle more than one session in one test context.
Every session has a defined session key.
If no key was set, the default session key is called `default`.

The following example creates two independent browser sessions:

[source,java]
----
WebDriver driver = WebDriverManager.getWebDriver();
WebDriver driverWindow2 = WebDriverManager.getWebDriver("window2");

// Get the session key
String key1 = WebDriverManagerUtils.getSessionKeyFrom(driver);        // key1 contains 'default'

String key2 = WebDriverManagerUtils.getSessionKeyFrom(driverWindow2); // key2 contains 'window2'
----

== Close a session

In most cases it is not needed to close your session manually.
Testerra always closes all open session at the end of a test method.

If you want to reuse a session in the next test method, you can deactivate the automatic close.

.test.properties
[source,properties,subs="attributes"]
----
// Default value is true
{wdm_closewindows_aftertestmethods}=false
----

To close active sessions manually, do the following:

[source,java]
----
// Close all active session in the current test context.
WebDriverManager.shutdown();

// Close all active session without check the wdm.closewindows.aftertestmethods property
WebDriverManager.forceShutdown()

// Close all active session in all current parallel test threads.
WebDriverManager.forceShutdownAllThreads()
----

[NOTE]
====
Testerra calls `WebDriverManager.shutdown()` automatically at the end of every test method.

At the end of the test run Testerra always calls `WebDriverManager.forceShutdown()` to cleanup all sessions.

Please do not use Selenium provided methods to close `WebDriver` sessions.
Have a further read in our known issue section: <<Closing `WebDriver` sessions without using Testerra `WebDriverManager`>>.
====

== Shared sessions in one thread

You can reuse the wedriver session in the following test by setting the following property:

.test.properties
[source,properties,subs="attributes"]
----
{wdm_closewindows_aftertestmethods}=false
----

.Working with shared sessions
[source,java]
----
@Test
public void test1() {
    WebDriver driver = WebDriverManager.getWebDriver();
    ...
}

@Test
public void test2() {
    // You get the already opened session from test1
    WebDriver driver = WebDriverManager.getWebDriver();
    ...
}
----

IMPORTANT: You can only reuse the session in the current thread.
If you run parallel tests, you have no access to the session between parallel test threads.

== Shared sessions over different threads

To use a browser session over different test threads, you need an _exclusive_ session.

Exclusive sessions are identified by a special uuid, not by the standard session key.

.Create exclusive browser sessions
[source,java]
----
private static String uuid = null;

@Test
public void test1() {
    WebDriver driver = WebDriverManager.getWebDriver();
    uuid = WebDriverManager.makeSessionExclusive(driver);
}

@Test
public void test2() {
    // Get the exclusive session
    WebDriver driver = WebDriverManager.getWebDriver(uuid);
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
=====
An exclusive session has an unlimited lifetime.
You need do close this session manually.

[source,java]
----
@AfterTest
public void cleanup() {
    WebDriverManager.shutdownExclusiveSession(uuid);
}
----
=====
