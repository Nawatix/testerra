= Retries

In some situations you cannot rely on single assertions or waits anymore and need to continue trying something out before performing an alternative solution.

Therefore, the `TestController` interface provides a `retryFor` method for repeating a couple of actions within a loop until a timeout has reached.

For example, this retry block tries to click a button until it's disabled.

[source,java]
----
CONTROL.retryFor(int seconds, () -> {
    button.click();
    button.expect().enabled(false);
});
----

You can also perform something when the retry block fails.

[source,java]
----
CONTROL.retryFor(int seconds, () -> {
    element.expect().text(String);
}, () -> {
    element.getWebDriver().reload();
});
----

You can combine control features to completely disable the internal element timeout.

[source,java]
----
CONTROL.retryFor(int seconds, () -> {
    CONTROL.withTimeout(0, () -> {
        button.click();
        uiElement.scrollIntoView();
        uiElement.expect().visible(boolean complete).is(boolean);
    }
);
