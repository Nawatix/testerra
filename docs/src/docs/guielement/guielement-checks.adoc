= Checks

Similar to the assertion methods GuiElement provide so called check methods.

[source,java]
----
GuiElement element = new GuiElement(driver, By.xpath("//div");

// The availability of elements can check by the following methods
element.isPresent();
element.isDisplayed();

// The following methods are calling the standard webelement method
element.inEnabled();
element.isSelected();

// Tries to find out if an element could be selected.
element.isSelectable();
----

[NOTE]
======
Method `isDisplayed` checks the following 3 issues:

* element is present in the DOM
* element is visible (not hidden by another element) and
* the element is inside the viewport.
