= Checks

Similar to the assertion methods GuiElement provide so called check methods.

== Visibilty checks

Checks if the element is present in the DOM
[source,java]
----
element.isPresent();
----

Checks if the element is present in the Viewport,
if it's visible by it's `display` and `visibility` style properties
and it's `width` and `height` are both greater than 0.
[source,java]
----
element.isDisplayed();
----

Checks if the element is displayed and if it's partially or `fully` visible
in the scroll area of the viewport.

[source,java]
----
element.isVisible(boolean fullyVisible);
----

NOTE: It doesn't relate to `opacity` or `z-index` style properties. If you need to test the perceptually visibility to the human eye, you should consider to implement <<LayoutCheck>>.

== Standard WebElement checks

[source,java]
----
// The following methods are calling the standard webelement method
element.inEnabled();
element.isSelected();

// Tries to find out if an element could be selected.
element.isSelectable();
----
