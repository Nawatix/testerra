= Desktop WebDriver utilities

This utility class provides some additional methods to interact with web elements.

All methods using JavaScript snippets to execute an action instead the Selenium way.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please consider this utility class as a fallback solution.

It could be useful if elements are hidden or not reachable by Selenium.

== Supported actions

.A short clickJS example
[source,java]
----
GuiElement element = new GuiElement(driver, By.id("label"));
DesktopWebDriverUtils utils = new DesktopWebDriverUtils();

utils.clickJS(element);
----

The following methods are supported:

* clickJS()
* rightClickJS()
* doubleClickJS()
* mouseOverJS()
* clickAbsolute()
* mouseOverAbsolute2Axis()

See <<Mouse over>> for more details about the `mouseOverAbsolute2Axis` method.

== `mouseOver` vs. `mouseOverAbsolute2Axis`

The `mouseOverAbsolute2Axis` method does not move the mouse pointer relativly from the last position.

The following graphic shows 2 different mouse pointer paths beginning at the upper right image to the button 1.

.Two possible mouse paths

The standard path (green) goes over a menu with hover effects.
This could hide your target element.
The blue path variant always goes first to the point (0,0) of the viewport, then in x and y direction the the target element.
