= Certificate Utilities
include::../properties/property-attributes.adoc[]

This is an utility class that offers the possibility to trust all SSL certificates.

IMPORTANT: Accepting all SSL certs is a risk and should only be used in trusted environments.

[source,java]
----
// Trust all certificates in the current Java VM instance.
CertUtils.trustAllCerts();
----

[source,java]
----
// Trust only certificates for a special connection and a SSL socket factory.
HttpsURLConnection CertUtils.trustAllCerts(
    HttpsURLConnection connection,
    SSLSocketFactory sslSocketFactory
);

== Trusting hosts

You can trust specified hosts in a whitespace separated list like

[source, properties,subs="attributes"]
----
{cert_trusted_hosts}=example.com google.com
----

Or just trust any (**not recommended**)

[source, properties,subs="attributes"]
----
{cert_trusted_hosts}=*
